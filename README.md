# Health Insurance Cost Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs based on personal and lifestyle factors using data analysis and machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance charges (target variable)

## Objective
- Understand which factors affect health insurance costs
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build machine learning models to predict insurance charges

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression

## Outcome
The project identifies key cost-driving factors and evaluates model performance using regression metrics.
